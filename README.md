# hello-world
very first android program

My name is Eric Witowski, I am a human in search of my dream in programming and mobile app development, I love to hang out with friends, work hard and make my kids successful.
I love espresso and working late, and playing hard, I work 48 hours a week in mobile app development and plan on working just as hard as I have to as long as it takes to get to where I need to go.
